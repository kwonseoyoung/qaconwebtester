			<h2 style = "text-align: center;"> Community Agreements </h2>
				<div class = "mainpage">
					<p> Here are some common community agreements that we ask y’all to observe and practice, not only during the workshop and Storytime components of the conference, but throughout the entire weekend: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> <strong> Assume Positive Intent (API) </strong> </li>
						<p> Not everyone comes in with the same set of experiences and knowledge, so assume that the folx here are speaking with good intent and the willingness to learn. That being said, hold yourself to the same standard and be accountable for the impact of your actions and energy in the space. </p>
						<li> <strong> Be on Time </strong></li>
						<p>Try your best to be on time. If accessibility is an issue, feel free to ask the committee of your options! </p>
						<li> <strong> Confidentiality </strong> </li>
						<p> During and after the conference, share the lessons learned but not the names of the folks participating so as to not out anybody or share their stories and experiences without their consent. </p>
						<li> <strong> Don’t Giggle My Wiggle </strong></li>
						<p> Folx here have different tastes and preferences, so avoid antagonizing language like “I hate that,” or “ew.” Likewise, folx have different traumas and triggers, so avoid language that belittles or trivializes their experiences.</p>
						<li> <strong> One Mic </strong> </li>
						<p> When someone is talking, do not interrupt them or have side conversations. </p>
						<li> <strong> Respect (Platinum Rule) </strong></li>
						<p> Treat others the way they would like to be treated. Respect personal space, and respect gender pronouns. </p>
						<li> <strong> Self-Care, Self-Love </strong></li>
						<p> Please exercise self-care. If you need to leave a room or need to take time for yourself, please do so. </p>
						<li> <strong> (Shared)² </strong></li>
						<p> If you find yourself talking a lot, share the space, and if you have not yet contributed, feel free to share your own stories/opinions! </p>
						<li> <strong> Use “I” Statements </strong></li>
						<p> Speak from your own experiences rather than generalizing. </p>
					</ul>
					<p> Lastly, for this year, we would like to add the following community agreement: </p>
						<ul>
							<li> <strong> Community Accountability </strong></li> 
							<p> Throughout this conference, we must prioritize and protect femme, trans, disabled, dark-skinned, and mixed bodies that sit at the intersections of our identities. We must also listen to and uplift West Asian, South Asian, and Pacific Islander folx, all of whom are meant to be encompassed under the API umbrella, but often go overlooked. </p>
						</ul>
					<p> In the past, QACON has tended to provide the most space to “conventionally attractive,” masc/uline, cisgender gay (East) Asian bodies, and as we (the 2018 committee) check ourselves, we ask that y’all (the conference-goers) also be aware of your privileges in this space and how your decisions and actions may affect, microaggress, or otherwise invisibilize the bodies that not only need, but deserve our allyship in this space. Our community must be more mindful, and even in our eleventh year of organizing, we recognize and apologize for the times we have been silent. </p>

					<p> This list of agreements is open. If you’d like to add to or amend the list of community agreements at any point during the conference, please talk to a facilitator or committee member. </p>
