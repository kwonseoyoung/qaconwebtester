  	<p class = "mainpage"> REPLACE THIS TEXT. Every year, the queer and Asian conference (QACON) brings queer Asians and allies from across the nation to participate in engaging workshops, keynote speeches by prominent activists, performers, scholars, performances from our talented community, and so much more. We are proud to be hosting the 11th conference this year and we invite you to join us for three days of existence and resistance! </p>
  	<p class = "mainpage">The conference is free of charge with Saturday lunch provided. You may also request free housing provided by our volunteers. </p>

    <h3 style = "text-align: center; font-size: 200%"> OUR MISSION STATEMENT </h3>
    <p class = "mainpage"> 
      As queer Asians and Asian-Americans, we’re in a position that we’ve never been in before. 
      For the first time, there has been a wave of queer and Asian representation on screen, as well as in both social and traditional media. With the success of several mainstream films, we’re finally seeing narratives with actors who that look like us. However, there are few not yet many people in the media who are like us, who live the realities of day-to-day queer and Asian life. </p>

      <p> Off the big screen, our progress is internationally hindered by legislation. Several Asian governments have enforced anti-queer legislation. At home, the president has banned members of the trans community from serving in the U.S. military, while Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, and Vietnamese American families are being split up by ICE. This, however,That does not doesn’t mean that all of the recent social change within our community has been harmfulbad, though. The current U.S. Congress is the most diverse it has ever been, with a record number of queer and POC members, and for the first time, an openly gay candidate is running for president. Along the Asian front, we have seen the decriminalization of same sex intimacy in India. However, external progress must be mirrored by internal improvementprogress. As we move forward, we must be able to look back and recognize that our community has not served all of its members equally well. </p>

      <p> As our community fluctuates, so must we change. </p> 

      <p> This year’s theme is a nod to the collegiate community from which this conference grew this conference grew from. Fiat Flux: Let There Be Change reframes the University of California’s motto: Fiat Lux: Let There Be Light. It is not enough to shed light on these challenges; though important, acknowledgment of issues does not equate to improvement. We must seek to create and maintain space for institutional, personal, and communal change in order to shape our future. There is no doubt we are hurtling forward; however, we must reflect on our progress to ensure that we are headed in the direction that best serves the entirety of our community. </p>

      <p> Now in its twelfth year, the conference has shifted focus from predominantly strictly recognizing our most represented the more visible members to uplifting our more  marginalized members. The advantage of representation means that we now have an increased responsibility to advocate for ourselves, and to create spaces for change that can be populated by people who envision that same future know what the changes can be. As queer Asians and Asian Americans, we are familiar with how hard and how necessary it is to fight for space and representation. We must speak up and thoroughly understand examine ourselves and our community to find places where we can improve going forward. </p>

      <p> There is always work to be done. There must always be space for change. </p>
